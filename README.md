# Torchy

Augmented Reality tool designed to assist firefighters in seeing through smoke and navigating hazardous environments.  
Torchy overlays visual data such as hazard markers, teammate locations and environmental readings onto a live AR view.

## Features

- **Thermal Mode** – Simulated hotspots to identify heat sources.
- **Blueprint Mode** – Superimpose structural layouts for better navigation.
- **Fog Mode** – Visual simulation with ambient audio for low-visibility training.
- **Hazard Markers** – Place and remove hazards manually or via simulated gas detection.
- **Teammate Tracking** – Visual indicators and proximity alerts.
- **Snapshot Tool** – Capture and save current AR view.
- **Audio Feedback** – Hazard placement and fog ambience.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (Vanilla)
- `html2canvas` for snapshot capture
- Custom logic for hazard detection, movement, and collision alerts
